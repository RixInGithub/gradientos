# GradientOS Source
Hello! This is the official GradientOS source code.

Here, lies the GradientOS source as well as the building command that I use to build GradientOS source code into WebAssembly.
## Contributing
Contributing, as always, is done by forking, committing changes and making a pull request.

Don't worry, I will see it.
## Building
Firstly, clone this repo. Then...

If you're on Windows, run:
```bat
build.bat
```

Else, if you're on a UNIX-like system like Mac or Linux, run:
```sh
./build.sh
```
I didn't test the UNIX-like command, so keep that in mind.

If something goes wrong during building, make sure to open an issue with the error text.
